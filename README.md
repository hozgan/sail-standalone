# SAIL STANDALONE


## Introduction

Sail provides a Docker powered local development experience for Laravel that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Sail. Sail's simple CLI means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.


#### Installation

```
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt ghcr.io/hozgan/containers:php7 \
    composer require --dev hozgan/sail-standalone --for 2.0.0 #Â composer version
```

**Supported PHP Versions Are:**
- PHP5 ghcr.io/hozgan/containers:php5
- PHP7 ghcr.io/hozgan/containers:php7
- PHP8 ghcr.io/hozgan/containers:php8

#### Alias

```
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'
```

#### Initiate
```
sail init --runtime 5.6 --with mysql,redis
```
#### Sail Up / Down

```
sail up -d
```
